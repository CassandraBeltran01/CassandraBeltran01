      <h3>Happy place, Video Art, 2018</h3>
      <p>This video art project contains small clips of concerts that I've gone to over the summer and are special to me.
        Music has become a big part of my life and making this project with lots of edits and different effects really present how much I truly love music.
        Also how I sometimes wish I was able to see my concerts as well with more detail and designs.</p>

    <h3>Distorted, Glitch Art, 2018</h3>
    <p>I'm glitching the image I'm glitching because
      I want to see how a picture that is so valuable and perfect to me can be destroyed or changed completely.
       I took this picture, last year with my camera. In the picture, it's my mother and me holding the same rose in our hands at the Rose Garden here in San Jose. What I wanted to modify if I had to the choice to glitch what part I what wanted was, the area in making the picture lose it's color to black and white and blur. So in my perspective, I can make it look old and ancient. I will also emphasize the part of my mother's hand and mine to look like its frozen or it froze to represent something important.</p>

    <h3>Lonely , Sound Art, 2018</h3>
    <p>For this art piece, I wanted the tone to be darker and the mood sadder.
      Representing moments people felt lonely are gloomy.</p>

       <h3>Past,Present,Future, Composite Art, year</h3>
       <p>I feel like the picture I
          created didn't really erase any meaning to it but instead, more meaning to it.
          Instead of erasing items I kept overlapping them and adding more images to one picture.
          I feel like, by doing this it creates a bigger meaning of stating the true meaning behind it.
          This picture is an image of my front house.
          The gray picture on top on the image represents the past and how my " tree " looked like in 2011 and it brings
          back memories connected with it. The vibrant picture of my neighbor house present a bright moment in my life, it was in 2013 when
         I realized I was starting a new chapter in my life as a teenager. The pool painted bright blue is in 2015 as shown as a happy moment and best summer I had.
        I feel like this picture will be shown in a poster large, so people can see exactly what parts are old and new and what parts are changed.</p>

          <h3>Season Theme , Net Art, 2018</h3>
          <p>The Title of my Net Art project is,” Season Theme”. An the  I way created this is by changing up the fonts and adding different backgrounds in every page also I used the code to make “ marquee” to occur. I used it multiple times so it can appear
            across all the screen and it can be repeated. </p>

            <h3>Switched, Code Art, 2018</h3>
            <p>For this piece, I wanted to do something that represented good and evil,
              so for my code art, I used Disney as my theme. I wanted to so my audience that good happy side of Minnie and Mickey Mouse and then on a click of the button change it to something not pleasant.
              To represent that not everything is perfect. </p>
