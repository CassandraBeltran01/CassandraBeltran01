  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hello, My name is Cassandra Beltran. I’m majoring in Art/Photography at San Jose State University. This major interested me a lot because I grew up practicing and see the creative side of things. For example, without art, there's not photography. I believe photography has a big part of why art is art. I enjoy taking visual artwork so I’m able to show others the beauty of our world. Many people don’t stop and enjoy the little things in life so when I take pictures of things or specific moments, I’m able to present them to people and show them that in a couple of seconds you can see the beauty or uniqueness or what u can capture on a camera.</p>
  <p>A deep concept of what I work on is taking pictures of landscape and portraits. I find them interesting because in portraits you can capture a moment of someone's memory and keep forever if you capture it on film. For landscapes, you also capture a beautiful moment on film so you can later see it over and over again and get reminded of how a specific place is meaningful to you without visiting it multiple times. When I capture the picture on film I scan it or send it to myself so I’m able to fix up some touch ups and make it clear and visible to my audience.</p>
